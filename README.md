# BLENDER SOCIETY

I made a site dedicated to bring people together who want to learn 3D modelling in an online and social setting.
Regardless of budget, everyone can learn and explore the free software Blender.
The main idea was a clean, easily read site. As a join-site I kept the details and imagery to a minimum.

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
